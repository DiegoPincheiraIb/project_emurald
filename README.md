# Pokémon Eμrald

## About this proyect

Pokémon Emurald, also know as Pokémon Eμrald, is a decomp hack base project based off RHH's [pokemerald-expansionv1.8.4](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/) and pret's [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation projects. It takes pokemerald-expansion v1.8.4 and expands upon it, adding multiple QoL features and improvements, to make it a **fresh experience** for newcomers and veterans alike.

The project aims to **rework** Pokemon Emerald based on three main pillars:
1. Replayability
2. Balanced gameplay
3. Fun

## Main features

Because it takes RHH's expansion as base, almost [all the features of RHH's](RHH-README.md#what-features-are-included) are present, in one way or another. Features from various member of the community are present too, and also custom features.

[Here](FEATURES.md) is the complete list of features.

## Team
